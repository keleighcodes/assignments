            <p> 
                This is a 3-day juice cleanse challenge. This means you will only consume fresh juice and water for 3 days. Discipline and dedication will be two of the most important factors in achieving success. 
                Included in this challenge are the recommended recipes. Start each morning with the celery juice blend. Recipes containing mostly fruit are best reserved for the morning. Green juice recipes and those containing more vegetables should be consumed in the evening. 
                I recommend consuming 4-6 16oz juices each day during this challenge as well as your recommended water intake to maximize hydration levels. 
                GET ACTIVE! If you don't already live an active lifestyle, with the increased energy levels you will experience during this challenge this is the perfect time to get started! 
                Be prepared to practice mindfulness and document it each day throughout the challenge during your "daily check-in".
