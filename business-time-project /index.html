           <p>Welcome! I am beyond elated to guide you through your juicing journey. What is juicing? How should you get started? Whether you're here to lose weight, heal your body, detox, explore alternative routes to traditional medicine, increase energy, or whatever your reason could be, welcome. Juicing is the easiest and most convenient way to consume high levels of essential vitamins and minerals by delivering nutrients to the body in a form that is immediately absorbed. 
                This guide will provide you with all of the information you need to conduct a juice cleanse! </p> 

            <p>More than two-thirds of all ailments in the United States are directly related to nutritional deficiencies. Research shows that people who consume generous amounts of fruits and vegetables have a reduced risk of stroke, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Juicing is preventive medicine! The juice from fresh fruits and vegetables provide every nutrient needed for health and longevity. Ninety percent of the antioxidant action in produce is in the fruit, not the fiber. Juicing removes the fiber from produce, allowing the body to quickly absorb and assimilate nutrients. 
                Today, the benefits of fresh juice are more important than ever.</p>

            <p>The American diet has strayed dramatically from the diet that was meant for us, becoming unsustainable for a lifestyle meant for longevity. Soul food, fast food, and foods meant for comfort are killing us. Today, modern food processing relies on over-cooking and packaging that destroys the nutritional value before it can be consumed. Juicing puts nutrition back in your life! It condenses the nutrients of a variety of produce into one glass or serving. 
                Juicing will open you to an endless array of new tastes, flavors, and textures. Instead of crunching an apple or blending a tired smoothie recipe, create a new flavor using your favorite fruits and vegetables. The options are endless!</p>
